# Telegram credentialed proof

Status: **implementation complete; credentialed execution closed with owner-approved deviations**
for Telegram #9. The application, wizard, probes, owner recovery interface, and safe disposal path
are versioned. A dedicated test bot, closed supergroup, and temporary HTTPS callback were exercised
without enabling production traffic. The owner chose to retain the bot and group as test resources,
accepted their observed administrator rights, and accepted the explicitly `Not run` live scenarios
below rather than performing more manual Telegram actions.

Prepare an ignored `.env` whose `DATABASE_URL` names an isolated loopback `issue9` or `proof`
database, then run from the repository root with Node from `.node-version`:

```bash
pnpm credentialed-proof:wizard
```

Before BotFather opens, the wizard verifies the required CLI versions, repository root, ignored
destinations, an exact query-free loopback database URL, and owner login readiness. It loads the
selected `ENV_FILE` with `ENV_FILE_OVERRIDE=true`, so inherited environment values cannot win, and
gives the same settings to the application terminal. Probe capture and evidence paths are fixed to
ignored `.credentialed-proof/` files and cannot be redirected by environment. Its thirteen
resumable stages write credentials/provider
identifiers only to that mode-`0600` file. Machine observations are reduced to ordered stage
snapshots containing status vocabulary, current administrator-right names, booleans, version
ranges, redacted identity fingerprints, bounded-validity transition rows, and aggregate counts in
ignored mode-`0600` `.credentialed-proof/evidence.json`. Neither
file may be pasted into an issue, PR, log, or committed report. Static verification uses only
non-secret fixtures:

For a disposable proof chat, the owner may explicitly accept the administrator rights currently
reported by Telegram with `TELEGRAM_PROOF_OBSERVED_ADMIN_RIGHTS_ACCEPTED=true`. The probe records
that acceptance and the observed right names in private evidence. This proof-only override does
not change the application's runtime permissions or its production recommendation.

On a re-run, the existing bot and chat are reused without `/newbot` or `getUpdates`; prior redacted
evidence is retained under ignored mode-`0700` `.credentialed-proof/archive/`, the active evidence
file is restarted, and a fresh pre-scenario database baseline makes later aggregate deltas
unambiguous. Each run creates a new retry marker. Disposal persists a non-secret checkpoint before
each irreversible boundary, so an interruption after webhook removal, BotFather rotation, external
resource disposal, or local scrubbing resumes that stage without archiving the completed evidence.

```bash
bash -n scripts/credentialed-proof-wizard.sh
shellcheck -e SC2034 scripts/credentialed-proof-wizard.sh
CREDENTIALED_PROOF_DRY_RUN=1 ENV_FILE=<temporary-file> \
  bash scripts/credentialed-proof-wizard.sh
```

## Final evidence disposition

The reviewing agent observed the local evidence file and owner confirmations. No identifiers or
provider payloads are recorded in this document. `Live` means Telegram or the temporary callback
was exercised; `Automated` means the deterministic PostgreSQL integration corpus passed; `Not run`
means the provider-specific live behavior was not observed; `Retained by owner` means a disposable
resource was deliberately kept for non-production testing.

| Area | Required redacted observation | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Bot identity | `getMe` id/username match the dedicated BotFather bot; old token rejects after revoke | **Live:** identity match. **Not run:** old-token rejection. **Retained by owner:** active test-bot credential |
| Closed chat | private group/supergroup type, owner-confirmed client minimum, implied `can_manage_chat`, inherited global member permissions, and every current assignable administrator-right name | Live; observed rights accepted by owner and recorded privately |
| Webhook auth | correct secret accepted; missing/wrong secret rejected | Live temporary callback |
| Webhook durability | inbox insert precedes `2xx`; duplicate update remains one durable inbox item | Live temporary callback and isolated PostgreSQL database |
| Webhook retry | exact synthetic marker absent during observed HTTP `503`/pending state, then present once after retry with provider queue drained | **Not run:** stable provider-edge retry observation. **Automated:** application retry/deduplication behavior |
| Contactability | ordinary `/start`, block diagnostic, unblock + new `/start` recovery | **Not run:** live private start/block/unblock. **Automated:** Contactability transitions and delivery diagnostics |
| Link bearer | valid, expired, replay, concurrent consume, same-pair idempotence, conflict | Automated |
| Membership | each reachable raw status/is-member pair is correlated to common normalization; ordered revisions show removal deny and newer rejoin restore | Automated |
| Reconciliation | `chat_member` is temporarily excluded, the missed removal leaves the pre-cadence revision unchanged, exact updates are restored, then a current bounded `reconciliation` denial supersedes the positive revision | Automated |
| Provider loss | bot demotion and provider outage degrade/fail closed; restoration recovers | **Not run:** live provider loss/restoration. **Automated:** fail-closed and recovery behavior |
| Owner recovery | dry-run read-only; exact-confirm execute; idempotent replay; immutable audit | **Not run:** destructive temporary-account rehearsal. **Automated:** full recovery interface and audit behavior |
| Disposal | webhook removed, pending test updates disposed, old token rejected, chat/endpoint/secrets disposition recorded, provider identifiers removed from `.env` | **Live:** webhook/pending updates and temporary endpoint disposed. **Not run:** token rejection and local scrub. **Retained by owner:** bot, chat, and ignored local credentials for non-production testing |
| Secret scan | Git tree, issue, PR, durable report, and captured output contain no token, raw PII, chat ID, or provider payload | Pass |

The tested application revision is `ed400df`; the proof window ended at approximately
2026-08-31 18:50 UTC. `pnpm check:full` passed with 113 unit and 73 PostgreSQL integration tests,
GitHub Application CI passed, and Standards and Spec reviews both returned PASS on that revision.

## Final report fields

When complete, add only:

- tested Git revisions and a rounded UTC proof window;
- boolean result for every row above;
- observed Telegram status and administrator-right vocabulary without chat/user/bot identifiers;
- ordered stage snapshots with aggregate counts, evidence-version ranges, and redacted correlated Membership source/raw/normalized/decision/revision/freshness transitions;
- owner recovery fingerprints, never raw references;
- token/webhook/chat/endpoint disposal booleans;
- Standards and Spec review verdicts.

Production domains, permanent credentials, deploy, monitoring, traffic, and production GO remain
outside this proof.

## Official facts reverified 2026-08-31

- [Telegram Bot Features](https://core.telegram.org/bots/features#creating-a-new-bot) documents
  `/newbot`, token secrecy, and `/token` rotation through BotFather.
- [Telegram Bot API](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#setwebhook) defines the HTTPS callback,
  supported ports, non-`2xx` retry, separate secret header, exact `allowed_updates`,
  `getWebhookInfo`, and pending-update disposal.
- [`chat_member`](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#chatmemberupdated) requires the bot to be an
  administrator and the update type to be explicitly selected; `getChatMember` for another user is
  guaranteed only while the bot is an administrator.
- [Telegram webhook guide](https://core.telegram.org/bots/webhooks) owns the current TLS, port,
  certificate, and reachability requirements for the temporary callback.
